# Blackjack-Project
My version of Blackjack. It is a text based program that uses the numbers between 1 and 11 to represent the cards deck used in the original game.

In this project I learned:
- How to assing funtions to variables
- Work with functions with outputs
- How to differentiate the print function from the return function
